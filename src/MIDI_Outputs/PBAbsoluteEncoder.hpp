 * This version cannot be banked.

     * @brief   Construct a new PBAbsoluteEncoder object with the given pins, 
     *          address, channel, speed factor, and number of pulses per step.
     * 
     * @param   pins
     *          A list of the two pins connected to the A and B outputs of the
     *          encoder.  
     *          The internal pull-up resistors will be enabled by the Encoder
     *          library.
     * @param   address
     *          The MIDI channel [CHANNEL_1, CHANNEL_16] and optional Cable
     *          Number [CABLE_1, CABLE_16].
     * @param   multiplier
     *          A constant factor to increase the speed of the rotary encoder.
     *          The position will just be multiplied by this factor. 
     * @param   pulsesPerStep
     *          The number of pulses per physical click of the encoder.
     *          For a normal encoder, this is 4. If you want to increase the
     *          resolution, for the use of Jog wheels, for example, you can go
     *          as 1.  
     *          Whereas a greater speedMultiplier factor will increase the 
     *          speed, increasing the number of pulsesPerStep will result in a 
     *          lower speed.

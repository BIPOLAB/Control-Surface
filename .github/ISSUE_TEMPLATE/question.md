**Post your code**
- Please post the _full_ code required to answer your question. Post your code even if it doesn't work or doesn't compile.
- If the code doesn't do what you expect, include a detailed description of what you want the code it to do.
- Don't post code that is too long. Narrow down the problem, try one component or aspect of your project at a time.
- Don't post snippets, always post a complete (compilable) sketch.
- Post your code between triple back ticks with the `cpp` language specifier, as shown below. This ensures that the code is displayed correctly and that syntax highlighting is enabled. (See the [GitHub Markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).)

```cpp
// Your code here
```

**Mention the board and specific software versions you're using**
- Please provide details of the relevant hardware, especially which Arduino board you're using.
- Post the version of the Control Surface library you're using, either the stable release version number or the git commit hash if you're on `master` or a feature branch.
- Post the version of the Arduino IDE and (most importantly) the version of the Arduino Core you're using for your specific board (see Tools > Board > Boards manager).
